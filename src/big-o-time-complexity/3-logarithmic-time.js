// O(log(n)) — Logarithmic Time:

// Logarithmic Time Complexity refers to an algorithm that runs in proportionally to the logarithm of the input size. Now, if you haven’t worked with Binary Search Trees, this may be a little difficult to conceptualize, so I’ll try and demonstrate it clearly below.
