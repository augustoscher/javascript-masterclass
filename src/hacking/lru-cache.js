// Least Recent Used Cache Implementation
// A Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache organizes items in order of use, allowing you to quickly identify which item hasn't been used for the longest amount of time.
// Under the hood, an LRU cache is often implemented by pairing a doubly linked list with a hash map.
